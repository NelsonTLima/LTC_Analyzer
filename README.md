# LTC_Analyzer
 
This software function is to check Litecoin's "ask" and "bid" prices in 6 different crypto exchanges, and tell us how much money should we invest to get profit by doing an arbitrage. It also tells us how many times did we get more than 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 percent of profit since it started running.
